  <p>In the rapidly changing society, the government funding plays a vital role in the process of development. 2The flow of money determines the direction and the results of the social development. 4Whether the government should spend their funds on the investment of the art or use the money to support the sport industry has been under heated discussion. 6Some people hold the view that the money should be used to pay for the construction of the art. I think, 7however, government should give priority to the investment on the athletics.</p>
<p>Admittedly, art culture is really important in our society since the prosperity of the humanities could be largely owed to the success of the art.</p>
<p>Also, the art culture contributes and enriches people’ s life in various ways.</p>
<p>If the government could subsidize the art-related project, It can add spice to people ‘ s routine life, which means that people have more choices to have a fun, like going to a gallery to appreciate the paintings or attending an art-history meeting to know more about different kinds of patterns of the art in the past. Furthermore, sponsoring the art can also favor our economic development. 21 20For instance, the museums and the art galleries can be developed into hot tourist attractions, which could bring huge profitability. 25 24However, I still believe that the development of art seems not indispensable, especially when compared to the athletics.</p>
<p>First of all, there is undeniable that the development of the sport places can improve the citizens ‘ health condition. 29As is known to all, sport is really the best manner for us to keep healthy. 31Attending more sport games can stimulate our metabolism and then ameliorate physical function. 32Only in this way can people become more healthy and long-lived. 33Take myself as an example, I used to be a very lazy person and my health condition is not very well for a long period of time. 34One day, my friend told me that a public athletic ground opened near my home and it is really convenient for me to take exercises. 35From then on, every day after school, I would go there to do exercises, like playing badminton and skating. 37By doing this, I succeed in losing weight 38 and my physical function becomes better. 40 39In addition, athletics can favor our mental health since it can makes people feel relaxing and comfortable. 43 42Supposing when we back home after finishing a tired day ‘ s work, if we can lying on the sofa and see a football game, it will be a great relaxation. 45 44Therefore, from my perspective, supporting the athletics is essential.</p>
<p>In the second place, the athletics sport brings people not only the physical and mental health, but also the spiritual inspiration. 48The principle of the competitive sport is never give up, which can influences people in a positive way. 50Many people are facing extremely high pressure because of the fierce competitions and the overload works, which make them become more vulnerable and more willing to abandon. 52 51Nevertheless, if they have the chance to see a sport match, they may change their mind when seeing how tough the process of a victory and how difficult for the sportsman to struggle for the honor. 55 54For example, LiuXiang, my favorite athlete, has suffered from the leg injuries for many years, but he still insisted on participating the competitions in order to win glory for his country until his doctor told him that if he took part in a competition again, his leg would be useless. 58There are plenty of examples like this. 59The spirit of these athletes teaches us a lot. 60Thanks to it, we can realize that we should never give up easily no matter how hard the work and the life are.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I am a firm believer that the athletics should be given more priority than the art. 65In such cases, people can live a more healthy and active life.</p>
<p>1Generally speaking, I believe that it is better for all concerned if young adults continue to live with their families for a longer time, particularly if they are going to be studying at university or something similar.</p>
<p>2First of all, it’s important to consider finances.</p>
<p>3In additions to the importance of finances, I think this is better for a young adult’s study potential.</p>
<p>反驳立论</p>
<p>4Finally, staying at home with one’s parents doesn’t necessarily mean that a young adult cannot develop independence.</p>
<p>5By way of conclusion, based on the arguments explored above, I’m of the opinion that in most cases it’s actually more beneficial for most adults to continue living with their families for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>5min</p>
<p>6These days it costs a lot to rent a house, attend university, buy a car or purchase things like insurance. By way of example, I can recall trying to live independently outside the family home as a university student and I constantly struggled to pay bills and meet all the other costs of living as a young adult.</p>
<p>7 With your family’s support, it’s a lot easier to focus on your studies. You are more likely to eat better meals, have a quiet place to do school work and get a decent night’s sleep. I can recall a friend from my university days who lived in share house with other students. Life was a party for him but he didn’t eat or study well and inevitably his grades suffered. He had to repeat several subjects and finished his degree later than many of his peers.</p>
<p>后果，细节</p>
<p>8 Even though I spent most of my university days living with my parents, they respect me as an adult as well as their child and they didn’t attempt to interfere too much or limit my independence. I think this is the case for many other young people as well, so I don’t think it is necessarily fair to claim that, just because someone is living with their family, they are somehow unable to enjoy benefits of independence.</p>
<p>10min</p>
<p>Concession statements</p>
<p>9 Becoming an adult is a really special time in anybody’s life and the call to head out into the world and embrace our independence is, for many people, quite powerful. I think this can depend on a lot of different needs and priorities compared to a person who intend to go on and study at university.</p>
<p>10 Certainly, it is possible for some young adults to get work and support themselves relatively quickly. However, in most parts of the world</p>

<p>11 This in turn had adverse effects for things like my study performance. Hence</p>
<p>To show this is not always the case</p>
<p>12 Of course, for some people in some situations, the family situation may actually be quite distracting for stressful. However, I think it would be fair to say that (for most people) you are more likely to</p>
<p>5min</p>
<p>13 I’ll be the first to admitted that there are parents out there who struggle to acknowledge that their children have grown up and deserve treatment as adults; it’s instinctive in many of them to continue to play a “mothering” role that can actually be quite stifling for a young adult.</p>
<p>14 Despite this possibility,</p>
<p>15 In fact, I believe the safe environment of the family is a good place to handle the transition to adulthood for all concerned, both the child and the parents.</p>
<p>显示条件 创造对比</p>
<p>16 Families are precious things and an essential part of the fabric of a nurturing society, so l have a strong belief that they can be a powerful guide in helping children negotiate the path to independence.</p>
