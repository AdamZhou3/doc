<ul>
<li><p>The reading material claims that it can be true that Peary has reached the North Pole. On the other hand, in the lecture, the professor states that the arguments that support the truth of Peary’s statement are not convincing at all. And the professor cast doubt on the reading passage by offering three specific points.</p></li>
<li><p>First of all, the professor makes the point that the investigation conducted by the National Geographic Society is not objective, because, in the Society, there were many Peary’s friends and gave a lot of money to Peary for his adventure. The investigation was only last for two days. This directly challenges the belief in the passage that the investigation is persuasive enough to Peary’s claim.</p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, contrary to the statements in the reading passage that Peary can reach the North Pole in less than 37 days by giving the evidence that Avery made the same trek at the same time. The professor asserts that in Peary’s adventure, he carried more weight, and the weather is more unfavorable, this makes it too tricky for Peary to reach the Pole.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the professor indicates that the photographs taken by Peary has been faded over time and can’t judge the Sun’s position just by the faded shadow in the photograph. This is in direct contradiction with the claim in the passage that these photographs can be strong evidence that Peary has reached the North Pole.</p></li>
<li><p>In conclusion, the contents in the reading  passage are entirely refuted by the professor, who uses three convincing points to weaken the arguments in the passage.</p></li>

<li><p>By way of conclusion, based on the arguments explored above, I am of the opinion that in most cases it</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There has been constant drumbeat over whether or not technology has made children more creative than they were in the past. Despite dynamic efforts to settle the debate, thus far, a consensus has been lacking. Generally speaking, I think it is better for all concerned to say that children have been more creative than they were in the past with the help of technology, especially when they embrace technology at an early age.</p></li>
<li><p>First of all, it is essential to consider the knowledge that children have to learn. Indeed, it is possible for some children that they can get more knowledge without using new technology. However, for the most part of the world, these days, technology provides a more convenient way to access more experience in a limited time. I can recall trying to search for what is an animal in the books when I am a child, and nowadays, you can get information like this by a connected phone. The developments of technology, in turn, had significant effects on things like children’s creative performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, in addition to the importance of accessible knowledge, I think it is better for children’s potential. With the help of technology,  there will be more new patterns of things and forms of intelligence that can be introduced to them, like VR or something else. These things will arouse their inspiration to create a new idea. Admittedly, for some children in some situations, it may be addicted to the new forms of technology as web games, and they might not be able to get rid of it. Nevertheless, considering there have been constant constraints over the time that children can have on these addicting things, I think it would be fair to say that it is adequate for children to embrace the developments of technology.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, using new technology doesn’t necessarily mean that children cannot develop their creativeness. I will be the first one to admit that the creation depends on what time we saw it. Despite this possibility, I think it would be fair to say that nowadays there is more creation in this exact era. I believe this is the case for other children as well, so I do not believe it is necessarily fair to claim that technology has made less creative than they were in the past.</p></li>
<li><p>By way of conclusion, based on the arguments discussed above, I am of the opinion that, in most cases, it is more beneficial for most children to embrace the new technology to get more inspiration.</p></li>
