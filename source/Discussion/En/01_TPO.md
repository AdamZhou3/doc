In  seeking  to  describe  the  origins  of  theater,  one  must  rely  primarily  on  speculation,  since there is little concrete evidence on which to draw. The most widely accepted theory, championed by  anthropologists  in  the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries,  envisions  theater  as emerging  out  of  myth  and  ritual.  The  process  perceived  by  these  anthropologists  may  be summarized briefly. During the early stages of its development, (* theories of the origins of theater  theories of the origins of theater ?*)a society becomes aware of forces that appear to influence or control its food supply and well-being. Having little understanding of natural causes, it attributes both desirable and undesirable occurrences to supernatural or magical forces,  and  it  searches  for  means  to  win  the  favor  of  these  forces.  Perceiving  an  apparent connection between  certain actions  performed  by  the group  and the result it  desires, the group repeats, refines and formalizes those actions into fixed ceremonies, or rituals. 

Stories  (myths)  may  then  grow  up  around  a  ritual.  Frequently  the  myths  include representatives  of  those  supernatural  forces  that  the  rites  celebrate  or  hope  to  influence. 
Performers  may  wear costumes  and masks  to  represent  the mythical characters  or supernatural forces in the rituals or in accompanying celebrations. As a person becomes more sophisticated, its conceptions  of  supernatural  forces  and  causal  relationships  may  change.  As  a  result,  it  may abandon or modify(修正，减轻) some rites. But the myths that have grown up around the rites may continue as part of the group’s oral tradition and may even come to be acted out under conditions divorced from these rites. When this occurs, the first step has been taken toward theater as an autonomous activity,  and  thereafter（此后）  entertainment  and  aesthetic（美学的）  values  may  gradually  replace  the  former mystical and socially efficacious concerns.   

故事（神话）在这种仪式中发展起来，这些故事中经常会有仪式庆祝或期望影响的超自然力量的典型。在这种仪式或伴随的庆典中，表演者们可能会穿上戏装和面具来扮演神秘的角色或超自然力量。当人们认识事物的能力进一步加强的时候，他们对超自然力量以及与其引发的事件间因果关系的认识就发生了改变；于是，他们会抛弃或者修改某些仪式。不过在这些仪式中发展起来的神话故事继续在人们的口头流传，甚至可能脱离了仪式而被演绎着。这时侯，戏剧做为一种自发的活动迈出了自己的第一步，接着，戏剧的娱乐和审美价值开始渐渐取代先前的带有神话色彩的、在社会上灵验的关注。

Although origin in ritual has long been the most popular, it is by no means the only theory about how the theater came into being. Storytelling has been proposed as one alternative. Under this theory, relating and listening to stories are seen as fundamental human pleasures. **Thus, the recalling of an event (a hunt, battle, or other feat) is elaborated through the narrator’s pantomime（打手势 表演） and impersonation（装扮） and eventually through each role being assumed by a different person. **

尽管戏剧起源于宗教仪式的说法是目前最被大众认可的，但无论如何这都不是戏剧起源的唯一理论；另一种推测认为戏剧源于说书。在这个理论中，与故事产生联系和聆听故事被视为是人类基本的乐趣。因此，讲述人通过自己的手势和模仿把对一个事件的回忆（一次打猎、战役或是其它功勋伟业）表现的淋漓尽致，这种方式最终演变成为由不同的人来演绎不同的角色。 

A closely related theory sees theater as evolving out of dances that are primarily pantomimic, 
rhythmical  or  gymnastic,  or  from  imitations  of  animal  noises  and  sounds.  Admiration  for  the performer’s  skill,  virtuosity,（精湛技巧）  and  grace  are  seen  as  motivation  for  elaborating（阐释）  the  activities  into fully realized theatrical（戏剧性的） performances.   

另外一种与之相关的理论认为，戏剧主要是从无声的、有节奏的舞蹈、体操，或模仿动物声音的过程逐渐演变而来。人们对表演者的演技、审美能力和优雅的欣赏被视为是表演者将他们的表演精心策划为戏剧的动力。 

In  addition  to  exploring  the  possible  antecedents  of  theater,  scholars  have  also  theorized 
about  the  motives  that  led  people  to  develop  theater.  Why  did  theater  develop,  and why  was  it valued after it ceased（stop） to fulfill the function of ritual? Most answers fall back on the theories about the human mind and basic human needs. One, set forth by Aristotle in the fourth century B.C., sees humans as  naturally  imitative—as  taking pleasure in imitating persons, things, and actions and in seeing such imitations. Another, advanced in the twentieth century, suggests that humans have a gift for fantasy, through which they seek to reshape reality into more satisfying forms than those  encountered  in  daily  life.  Thus,  fantasy  or  fiction  (of  which  drama  is  one  form)  permits people to objectify their anxieties and fears, confront them, and fulfill their hopes in fiction if not fact. The theater, then, is one tool whereby  people define and understand their world or escape from unpleasant realities.

为了进一步探寻戏剧的起源，一些学派开始从人类发展戏剧的动机上建立理论。为什么戏剧会发
展，为什么在戏剧完全脱离宗教仪式以后还有这么大的价值？大部分答案都回到那些关于人类心智和
人类基本需求的理论中。首先，亚里士多德在公元前 4 世纪提出，人们天生好模仿，并从模仿他人、
事物和动作以及观看模仿中获得乐趣。另外，20 世纪提出的先进理论认为人类擅长幻想，通过幻想
将日常生活中的现实重塑成更加令人满意的形式。因此，人们通过幻想或虚构（戏剧的一个形式）把
他们的焦虑和恐惧具体化，再通过这种方式面对焦虑和恐惧，并从虚构中满足他们现实中无法实现的
愿望。所以，戏剧成为了一种帮助人们认识和理解这个世界，或是帮助人们逃避不满现实的工具。 

But  neither  the  human  imitative  instinct  nor  a  penchant  for  fantasy  by  itself  leads  to  an
autonomous  theater.  Therefore,  additional  explanations  are  needed.  One  necessary  condition seems  to  be  a  somewhat  detached  view  of  human  problems.  For  example,  one  sign  of  this condition is the appearance of the comic（喜剧的） vision, since comedy requires sufficient detachment to view some deviations from social norms as ridiculous rather than as serious threats to the welfare of the entire group. Another condition that contributes to the development of autonomous theater is  the  emergence  of  the  aesthetic  sense.  **For  example,  some  early  societies  ceased  to  consider certain rites essential to their well-being and abandoned them, nevertheless, they retained as parts of their oral tradition the myths that had grown up around the rites and admired them for their artistic qualities rather than for their religious usefulness.   **

但是，无论是人类模仿的本能或是对幻想的嗜好本身都不能发展成为独立的戏剧，因此，我们需要更多解释。一个必要的条件可能是一种要脱离通常人们看待问题的视角。比如，这个条件的一个标志是喜剧构想的出现，因为喜剧要求足够的发散思维，我们需要将社会规范中的离经叛道的行为视作极其荒谬的事情，而不是对公众群体福利的严重威胁。另一个导致戏剧独立的条件是审美感觉的出现。例如，一些早期社会的人们认为有的仪式对他们的幸福生活来说不再是必需品，并且取消了那些仪式。虽然如此，人们还是保留了那些口头传述故事的传统并且热爱从这些仪式里发展起来的神话，出于它
们的艺术性，而不是宗教原因。

○A  society’s  rites  were  more  likely  to  be  retained  in  the  oral  tradition  if  its  myths  were 
admired for artistic qualities. 

○The artistic quality of a myth was sometimes an essential reason for a society to abandon it 
from the oral tradition. 

○Some early societies stopped using myths in their religious practices when rites ceased to be 
seen as useful for social well-being. 

○Myths sometimes survived in a society’s tradition because of their artistic qualities even after 
they were no longer deemed religiously beneficial.   4

Student
Hi, um…, I really hope you can help me.

Librarian
That’s why I’m here. **What can I do for you?**

Student
I’m supposed to do a literature review for my psychology course, but um… having a hard time finding articles. I don’t even know where to start looking.

Librarian
You said this is for your psychology course, right? So your focus is on …

Student
Dream Interpretation.

Librarian
Well, you have a focus, so that’s already a good start. Hmmm… well, there’re a few things… oh wait… ==have you checked to see if your professor put any material for you to look at on reserve?==

Student
Aha, that’s one thing I did know to do. I just copied an article, but I still need three more on my topic from three different journals.

Librarian
==Let’s get you going on looking for those then==. ==We have printed versions of twenty psychology journals in the Reference Section.== These are the ones published within the last year. Then I think about it… there’s a journal named SleepandDream.

Student
Oh, yeah, the article I just copied is from that journal, so I’ve got to look at other sources.

Librarian
Ok, actually, **most of our materials are available electronically now**. You can access psychology databases or electronic journals and articles through the library’s computers, and if you want to search by title with the word ‘dream’ for example, just type it in and all the articles with ‘dream’ in the title will come up on the screen.

Student
Cool, that’s great! Too bad I cannot do this from home.

Librarian
==But you can==. All of the library’s databases and electronic sources can be accessed through any computer connected to the university network.

Student
Really?! I can’t believe I didn’t know that.==It still sounds like it’s going to take a while though, you know, going through all of that information, all of those sources.==

Librarian
Maybe, but you already narrow your search down to articles on Dream Interpretation, so it shouldn’t be too bad. And you probably notice that **there’s an abstract or summary at the top of the first page of the article you copied.** When you go into the databases and electronic sources, you have the option to display the abstracts on the computer screen, skimming those to decide whether or not you want to read the whole article should cut down some time.

Student
Right, abstracts! They’ll definitely make the project more durable.**I guess I should try out the electronic search while I’m still here then, you know, just in case.**

Librarian
Sure, er… that computer’s free over there, and **I’ll be here till five this afternoon.**

Student
Thanks, I feel a lot better about this ==assignment== now.

### L Lec 1

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a ==contemporary art== class.

Professor
Ok, I’m going to begin this lecture by giving you your next assignment. ==Remember I said that at some point during this semester I wanted you to attend an exhibit at the Fairy Street Gallery and then write about it?== Well, the exhibit that I want you to attend is coming up. It’s already started in fact, but it’ll be at the gallery for the next month, which should give you plenty of time to complete this assignment.
The name of the artist exhibiting there is Rose Frantzen. **Frantzen’s work may be unfamiliar to you since she’s a ==relatively== (相对)young artist.** But she’s got a very unusual style, compared to some of the artists we’ve looked at this term. But anyway, Frantzen’s style is what she herself calls Realistic Impressionism. ==So you’ve probably studied both of these movements separately, separate movements, Realism and Impressionism==, in some of your art history courses. So who can just sum these up?

Student
Well, Impressionism started in the late 19th century. Um…the basic impressionist style was very different from earlier styles. It didn’t ==depict scenes or models exactly as they looked. Um… Impressionist painters tended to apply paint really thickly, and in big brushstrokes, so the texture of the canvas was rough.==

Professor
Good. What else? What were the subjects?

Student
Well, a lot of impressionist artists painted everyday scenes, like people on the streets and in cafes,lots of nature scenes, especially landscapes.

Professor
Good. So when you go to the exhibit, I really want you to take a close look at a certain painting.It’s a farm scene. And you will see it right as you enter the gallery. **The reason I think this painting is so important is that it stresses the impressionist aspect of Frantzen’s style**. It’s an outdoor scene, an everyday scene. ==It’s kind of bleak, which you can really see those broad brushstrokes and the blurry lines.==The colors aren’t quite realistic. The sky is kind of, well, in a natural… pinkish yellow. And the fence in the foreground is blue, but somehow the overall scene gives an impression of a cold, bleak, winter day on a farm. So that’s the impressionist side of her work. Oh, and speaking about farms, that reminds me. One interesting thing I read about Franzten is that when she first moved back to Iowa after living abroad, she often visited this place in her town called the Sales Barn. And the Sales Barn, it was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their cattle, their farm animals. And the reason Frantzen went there, and she later on would visit other places like dance halls, **was to observe people and the ways that they moved**. She really found that this helped her work---that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions, how humans move, and stand still, what their postures were like, too.
So, what about Realism? What are the elements of Realism we should be looking for in
Frantzen’s work?

Student
Um… ==real honest depictions of subject matter, pretty unidealized stuff, and pretty everyday
subject matter, too.==

Professor
Good. One other painting I really want you to look at is of a young woman surrounded by
pumpkins（南瓜）. **You will notice that the woman’s face is so realistic looking that it’s almost like aphotograph.** The woman’s nose is a little less than perfect and her hair is kind of messed up. This is realism. But then, the background of the painting, this woman with ==the pumpkins is wrapped in a blanket of broad thick brushstrokes==, **and, it’s all kinds of zigzagging brushstrokes and lines, kind of chaotic almost when you look at it close**. And there are vibrant colors. There’s lots of orange,==with little hints of an electric blue peeking out.==

**I find Frantzen to be a very accessible artist. I mean, some artists, to ==appreciate== them, you have to know their life story. But here’s a little bit about Rose Frantzen’s life anyway.** She attended art school, but was told by one of her instructors that she was not good at ==illustration==, that she should go into advertising instead. So she took advertising classes and fine arts classes too, until she was convinced by the head of an advertising agency that her work was really good, that she could be an artist. But of course, it’s not as easy as that, and so Frantzen had to paint other people’s portraits at places like art fairs just to make money to buy paint for her more series of art work. No matter what, she never stopped painting. And now, Frantzen is doing extremely well. And her work is being shown all over the country. **So I think most of us would be discouraged if we had to face challenges and difficulties like that. **But what’s important is that you keep at it that you don’t give up. That’s what is really important to remember.

### L Lec 2

Professor
Ok, let’s get started. Great. ==Today I want to talk about a way in which we are able to determine how old a piece of land, or some other geologic feature is== - **dating techniques**. I’m going to talk about a particular dating technique. Why? Good dating is a key to good analysis. In other words, if you want to know how a land formation was formed, the first thing you probably want to know is how old it is. It’s fundamental.

Um… ==Take the Grand Canyon for instance==. Now, we geologists thought we had a pretty good  idea of how the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States was formed. ==We knew that it was formed from sandstone that solidified 固化somewhere between 150 and 300 million years ago.== Before it solidified, it was just regular sand. <u>Essentially</u> it was part of a vast desert. ==And **until just recently, most of us thought the sand had come from an ancient mountain range fairly close by that flattened out over time**==. （直到最近，我们大多数人还认为沙子来自古老的山脉，随着时间的流逝，山峰变得很平坦）==That’s been the conventional wisdom among geologists for quite sometime.==这是相当一段时间以来地质学家的传统看法，But now we’ve learned something different, and quite surprising, using a technique called Uranium-Lead Dating.

I should say that Uranium-Lead Dating has been around for quite a while. But there have been some recent ==refinements.==细化 I will ==get into this in a minute.== Anyway, Uranium-Lead Dating has produced some surprises. Two geologists discovered that about half of the sand from the Grand Canyon was actually once part of the Appalachian Mountains. That’s really eye-opening news, since the Appalachian Mountain Range is, of course, thousands of kilometers to the east of the Grand Canyon. Sounds pretty unbelievable, right?

Of course, the obvious question is how did that sand end up so far west? The theory is that huge rivers and wind carried the sand west where it mixed in with the sand that was already there. Well, this was a pretty revolutionary finding. Um… and it was basically because of Uranium-Lead Dating. Why? Well, as everyone in this class should know,  **==we usually look at the grain type within sandstone, meaning the actual particles in the sandstone表示砂岩中的实际颗粒, to determine where it came from.==** You can do other things too, like look at the wind or water that brought the grains to their location and figure out which way it was flowing. But that’s only useful up to a point, and that’s not what these two geologists did. Uranium-Lead Dating allowed them to go about it in an entirely different way. What they did was: they looked at the grains of Zircon in the sandstone. Zircon锆石 is a material that contains radioactive Uranium, which makes it very useful for dating purposes. Zircon starts off as molten magma（熔岩）, the hot larva from volcanoes. This magma then crystallizes（结晶）. And when Zircon crystallizes,==the Uranium inside it begins to change into Lead==.里面的铀开始变成铅 So **if you measure the amount of Lead in the Zircongrain, you can figure out when the grain was formed. After that, you can determine the age of Zircon from different mountain ranges. Once you do that, you can compare the age of the Zircon in the sandstone in your sample to the age of the Zircon in the mountains.** If the age of the Zircon matches the age of one of the mountain ranges, then it means the sandstone actually used tobe part of that particular mountain range. Is everybody with me on that? Good.So, in this case, Uranium-Lead Dating was used to establish that half of the sandstone in the samples was formed at the same time the granite（花岗岩） in the Appalachian Mountains was formed. So because of this, this new way of doing Uranium-Lead Dating, we’ve been able to determine that one of our major assumptions about the Grand Canyon was wrong.

Like I said before, Uranium-Lead Dating has been with us for a while. But, um… until recently, in order to do it, you really had to study many individual grains. And it took a long time before yougot results. It just wasn’t very efficient. And it wasn’t very accurate. **But technical advances have cut down on the number of grains you have to study, so you get your results faster.** So I’ll predict that Uranium-Lead Dating is going to become an increasingly popular dating method. **There are a few pretty exciting possibilities for Uranium-Lead Dating. ==Here is one that comes to mind.== **You know the theory that earth’s continents were once joined together and only split apart relatively recently? Well, with Uranium-Lead Dating, we could prove that more conclusively. If they show evidence of once having been joined, that could really tell us a lot about the early history of the planet’s geology.

* Boats could carry heavy weights, but canals could not cross hilly terrain; turnpikes could cross the hills, but the roadbeds could not stand up under great weights. These problems needed still another solution, and the ingredients for it lay close at hand. In some industrial regions, heavily laden wagons, with flanged wheels, were being hauled by horses along metal rails; and the stationary steam engine was puffing in the factory and mine. Another generation passed before inventors succeeded in combining these ingredients, by putting the engine on wheels and the wheels on the rails, so as to provide a machine to take the place of the horse. Thus the railroad age sprang from what had already happened in the eighteenth century.

### R2 The commercialization of lumber 伐木业的商业化

```
By 1860, the settlement of the American West along with timber shortages in the East converged with ever-widening impact on the pine forests of the Great Lakes states.

No longer were farmers in search of extra income the main source for shingles, firewood, and other wood products.

In the 1870s, a set of snowless winters left lumber companies to ponder ways of liberating themselves from the seasons. Railroads were one possibility. At first, the remoteness of the pine forests discouraged common carriers from laying track. But increasing lumber prices in the late 1870s combined with periodic warm, dry winters compelled loggers to turn to iron rails.

There is constant drumbeat dedicated to the topic about where should the governments money spend on,  rights which are one of the cornerstones in the search for a science of cities. such search is an interdisciplinary quest, which can only be advanced through cumulative theories that build on ideas about how the form of cities determines their function and vice versa as well as localised knowledge that defines the particular characteristics of individual cities and the cultures. notions
