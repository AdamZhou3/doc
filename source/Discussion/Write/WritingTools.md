## Branch to the Right

###  "Right-branching sentence." 

* Begin sentences with <u>subjects and verbs</u>, letting subordinate elements branch to the right. Even a long, long sentence can be clear and powerful when the subject and verb make meaning early.
*  Lydia Polgreen  The New York Times leading sentence

>Rebels seized control of Cap Haitien, Haiti's second largest city, on Sunday, meeting little 
>resistance as hundreds of residents cheered, burned the police station, plundered food from 
>port warehouses and looted the airport, which was quickly closed. Police officers and armed 
>supporters of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide fled. 

That first sentence is 37 words long and rippling with action. The sentence is so full, in fact, 
that it threatens to fly apart like some overheated engine. But the writer keeps control by 
creating meaning in the first three words: "Rebels seized control..." Think of that main clause 
as the locomotive that pulls all the cars that follow. 

* John Steinbeck from "Cannery Row"

>He didn't need a clock. He had been working in a tidal pattern so long that he could feel a 
>tide change in his sleep. In the dawn he awakened, looked out through the windshield, and 
>saw that the water was already retreating down the bouldery flat. He drank some hot coffee, 
>ate three sandwiches, and had a quart of beer. 
>
>The tide goes out imperceptibly. The boulders show and seem to rise up and the ocean 
>recedes leaving little pools, leaving wet weed and moss and sponge, iridescence and brown 
>and blue and China red. On the bottoms lie the incredible refuse of the sea, shells broken and 
>chipped and bits of skeleton, claws, the whole sea bottom a fantastic cemetery on which the 
>living scamper and scramble.

In each sentence, Steinbeck places subject and verb at or near the beginning. Clarity and narrative energy flow through the passage, as one sentence builds upon another. And he avoids monotonous 
structure by <u>varying the length of his sentences.</u> 

* Subject and verb often get separated in prose, usually because we want to tell the reader something about the subject before we get to the verb. 

> A bill that would exclude tax income from the assessed value of new homes from the state education funding formula could mean a loss of revenue for Chesapeake County schools. 

Eighteen words separate the subject "bill" from its weak verb "could mean," a fatal flaw that turns what could be an important civic story into gibberish. 

* If the writer wants to create suspense, or build tension, or make the reader wait and wonder, 
    or join a journey of discovery, or hold on for dear life, she can save the verb until the end. 

### Workshop

*  Read through an edition of The New York Times with a pencil. Mark the location of subjects and verbs.  
*  When you struggle with a sentence, see if you can rewrite it by placing subject and verb at the beginning

## Use Strong Verbs 

###  Immediacy of experience

* Use verbs in their strongest form, the simple present or past. Strong verbs create action, 
    save words, and reveal the players. 
*   "From Russia With Love," the1957 James Bond adventure by Ian Fleming

>Bond *climbed* the few stairs and *unlocked* his door and *locked* and *bolted* it behind 
>him. Moonlight *filtered* through the curtains. He *walked* across and *turned* on the 
>pink-shaded lights on the dressing-table. He *stripped* off his clothes and *went* into the 
>bathroom and *stood* for a few minutes under the shower. … He *cleaned* his teeth and 
>*gargled* with a sharp mouthwash to get rid of the taste of the day and *turned* off the 
>bathroom light and *went* back into the bedroom. 
>
>Bond *drew* aside one curtain and *opened* wide the tall windows and *stood*, *holding* the 
>curtains open and *looking* out across the great boomerang curve of water under the 
>riding moon. The night breeze felt wonderfully cool on his naked body. He *looked* at 
>his watch. It *said* two o'clock. 
>
>Bond *gave* a shuddering yawn. He *let* the curtains drop back into place. He *bent* to 
>switch off the lights on the dressing-table. Suddenly he *stiffened* and his heart *missed* 
>a beat. 
>
>There had been a nervous giggle from the shadows at the back of the room. A girl's 
>voice *said*, "Poor Mister Bond. You must be tired. Come to bed." 

In writing this passage, Fleming followed the advice of his countryman George Orwell, who wrote of verbs: "**Never use the passive when you can use the active.**" 

Never say never, Mr. Orwell, lest you turn one of the writer's most reliable tools into a rigid rule. But we honor you for describing the relationship between language abuse and political abuse, and for revealing how corrupt leaders use the passive voice to obscure unspeakable truths and shroud responsibility for their actions. They say: "It must be admitted after the report is reviewed that mistakes were made," rather than, "I read the report, and I admit I made a mistake." 

* New York Times lead by Carlotta Gall

>  Waiflike, draped in a pale blue veil, Madina, 20, sits on her hospital bed, bandages covering the terrible, raw burns on her neck and chest. Her hands tremble. She picks nervously at the soles of her feet and confesses that three months earlier she set herself on fire with kerosene.

While Fleming used the past tense to narrate his adventure, Gall prefers verbs in the present tense. This strategy immerses the reader in the immediacy of experience, as if we were sitting – right now -- beside the poor woman in her grief. 

* Both Fleming and Gall avoid the verb qualifiers that attach themselves to standard prose like barnacles to the hull of a ship: 
    * Sort of  
    * Tend to  
    * Kind of  
    * Must have 
    * Seemed to
    * Could have 
    * Use to  

* Scrape away these crustaceans during revision, and the ship of your prose will glide toward meaning with efficient speed and grace. 

### Workshop

* Verbs fall into three categories: active, passive, and forms of the verb "to be." Review three of your stories and circle the verb forms with a pencil. In the margins, mark each verb by category. 
*  Look for occasions to convert passive or "to be" verbs into the active. For example, "It was her observation that …" becomes "She observed …"  
* In your own work and in the newspaper, search for verb attachments and see what happens when you cut them from a story.  
* Read "Politics and the English Language," by George Orwell. As you listen to political speech, mark those occasions when politicians or other leaders use the passive voice to avoid responsibility for problems or mistakes. 

##  Beware of Adverbs 

* Beware of adverbs. They can dilute the meaning of the verb or repeat it. 
* "Tom Swift" adventures

> "Look!" suddenly exclaimed Ned. "There's the agent now! ... I'm going to speak to him!" 
> impulsively declared Ned. 

That exclamation point after "Look" should be enough to heat the prose for the young reader,
but the author adds "suddenly" and "exclaimed" for good measure. Time and again, the writer
uses the adverb, not to change our understanding of the verb, but to intensify it. The silliness of this style led to a form of pun called the "Tom Swiftie," where the adverb conveys the punch line: 

> "I'm an artist," he said easily. 
> "I need some pizza now," he said crustily. 
> "I'm the Venus de Milo," she said disarmingly.
