Talk about a person you admire a lot and explain why you admire him or her. Use details and examples in your response.
## topic
Allen Iverson, the NBA superstar, is definitely one of the people for whom I have a huge admiration.
## support sentence
I admire him a lot because he is such a hard-working guy that you would feel like there’s nothing he cannot do. 
## example
Once I watched an interview of his coach in high school on NBC. He said that Allen was just super diligent. 
He was always the first person that arrived for the training, and always the last one to leave. 
He usually stayed for another 2 hours after all his teammates left for dinner. 
So it’s definitely his hard work that made him one of the most phenomenal players in the league.
```

```markdown
If you were going to take a trip alone, what would you take with you? Please include details in your response.
## topic
If I’m traveling myself, I guess I’ll take a lot of items with me, among which my iPad is a must. You know, it’s always pretty boring when you travel alone, especially when you’re on a plane or train. 
With iPad, I can do a lot of things to kill that kind of boring time. 
For example, I can chat with my friends through MSN or Facetime, play video games, watch movies, etc. I still have a very clear memory of my trip to Australia; it’s the iPad that got me through the tedious 10-hour flight. I can’t even imagine how bored I would be if I had to sit in the cabin doing nothing for such a long period of time.

```markdown
Some people like to have dinner in a restaurant. Others like to cook dinner for themselves. Which do you think is better, and why? Please use details and examples to explain your answer.
## topic
I have a pretty hectic life, so I guess having dinner in a restaurant is definitely a better choice for me. 
## support 
 You know, the problem is that I really don ’ t have that much time to cook for myself. 
## example
I can show you why it’s a mission impossible. I got off work every day probably some time between 7 and 8 . If I want to have dinner at home, I’m going to have to spend 1 hour buying food materials in the grocery store, and probably another 1  hour cooking — I’m a terrible cook, by the way. So when I ’ m done cooking, it ’ s around  10. I seriously doubt that I still want to eat, not just go to bed or something.
```

```markdown
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?“It is always better to have more than one leader in a group.” Use details and examples to explain your answer.
Admittedly, more people can contribute more ideas, but I don’t think having multiple leaders in a group always helps us work better. 
In many cases, this is quite a deficiency because it seriously slows down the decision making process. 
Let me give you an example. When I was in high school, I worked in the student union, and we have like 5 or 6 people who all believed they were in charge. Once we were trying to find a venue for a prom. People all seemed to have their own preferences and just didn’t want to make any concession. It took us 3 hours, yeah, 3 hours to reach a consensus. If there had been only one boss, we could have gotten a final plan much more quickly.

    * Becoming an adult is a really special time in any body’s life and the call to head out into the world and embrace our independence is, for many people, quite powerful. I think this can depend on a lot of different factors; for example, somebody starting a job might have different needs and priorities compared to a person who intends to go on and study at university. Generally speaking, I believe that it is better for all concerned if young adults continue to live with their families for a longer time, particularly if they are going to be studying at university.
    * First of all, it’s important to consider finances. Certainly, it is possible for some young adults to get work and support themselves relatively quickly. However, in most parts of the world these days it costs a lot to rent a house, attend university, buy a car or purchase things like insurance. By way of example, I can recall trying to live independently outside the family home as a university student and I constantly struggled to pay bills and meet all the other costs of living as a young adult. This in turn had adverse effects for things like my study performance.
    * Hence, in addition to the importance of finances, I think this is better for a young adult's study potential. With your family's support, it is a lot easier to focus on your studies. Of course, for some people in some situations, the family situation may actually be quite distracting or stressful. However, I think it would be fair to say that (for most people) you are more likely to eat better meals, have a quiet place to do school work and get a decent night's sleep if you happen to be living in the family home. I can recall a friend from my university days who lived in share house with other students. Life was a party for him but he didn't eat or study well and finished his degree later than many of his peers.
    * Finally, staying at home with one's parents doesn't necessarily mean that a young adult cannot develop independence. I will be the first to admit that there are parents out there who struggle to acknowledge that their children have grown up and deserve treatment as adults; it's instinctive in many of them to continue to play a 'mothering' role that can actually be quite stifling for a young adult. Despite this possibility, even though i spent most of my university days living with my parents, they respect me as an adult as well as their child and they didn't attempt to interfere too much or limit my independence. I think this is the case for many other young people as well, so I do not think it is necessarily fair to claim that, just because someone is living with their family, they are somehow unable to enjoy benefits of independence. In fact, I believe the safe environment of the family is a good place to handle the transition to adulthood for concerned, both the child and the parents.
    * By the way of conclusion, based on the arguments explored above, I am of the opinion that in most cases it's actually more beneficial for most adults to continue living with their families for a longer period of time. Families are precious things and an essential part of the fabric of a nurturing society, so I have a strong belief that they can be a powerful guide in helping children negotiate the path to independence.
